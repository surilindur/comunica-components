This is a monorepo that contains various work-in-progress components for [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica) and is not intended for actual use. If you wish to learn more about Comunica or actually use it, please refer to [its website](https://comunica.dev/).

This project can be setup by cloning and installing it as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/comunica/comunica.git
$ cd comunica
$ yarn install
```

There are no unit tests and nothing is guaranteed to function as one would expect it to.

### Issues

Please feel free to report any issues on the GitHub issue tracker, but do note that none of these components are intended for real use at this stage and are therefore not tested properly.
